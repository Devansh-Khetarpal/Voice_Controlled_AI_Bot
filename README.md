# Voice_Controlled_AI_Bot
This project showcases a voice-controlled personal assistant named "Devansh's AI Bot" that performs various web tasks using speech recognition and automation. Developed in Python, the assistant can interact with the user through voice commands, execute actions like opening websites (YouTube, Wikipedia, Google, ChatGPT, Instagram), playing local music files, displaying current time, and even logging into an Instagram account. Leveraging technologies such as speech_recognition, win32com.client, and webbrowser, the assistant enhances user experience through hands-free web browsing and task execution.
